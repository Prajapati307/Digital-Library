eBook Uploading: Enable users to upload eBooks in various formats (PDF, ePub, etc.) from their device into their personal library within the app.

Search and Categorization: Provide a search function that allows users to find uploaded eBooks based on title, author, genre, and language.

Reading Interface: Users can open and read the uploaded eBooks directly in the app with features like adjustable font size, background color options, and bookmarking.

Bookshelf/Collection: Create a bookshelf view where users can organize their uploaded books and track reading progress.

Cloud Sync: Implement cloud storage for users to store and access their eBooks across multiple devices.
